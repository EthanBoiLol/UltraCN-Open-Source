## Contribute

We welcome anyone who wishes to contribute to this project, however we do have a set of rules that you must follow in order to merge your changes to the main code

1. All changes will be forward to the 'Dev' branch, the dev branch is an experimental branch for running new content, the 'main/master' branch will only hold the current stable source code
2. Do not harass under any circumstance when commenting on issues or pull requests
3. All changes must be accurate to Ultra Custom Night 1.6.4 or below (though 1.6.4 is highly recommended), we understand not every single thing can be recreated due to restrictions, but don't add additional characters or features into the main source code.
4. any submission with malicious intent (such as malware, backdoor, troll, etc) will not be tolerated
5. Ensure your code has been tested properly before submitting
